## Creating the Model and Running the App
  1) Run the Flask API backend:
        python backend/app.py
     
  This will create and train the model if it hasnâ€™t been created already.

  3) Run the React frontend:
        cd frontend
        npm start
     
  Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 to access the app.
